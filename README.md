# Early Plant disease Detection
This was my Final year Undergraduate project done along with 2 other team members and my major responsibility was to develop a chatbot that could answer any query related to the detected plant disease

### Plant-Disease-Chatbot
Developed a chatbot using OpenAI's text davinci model and incorporated the technique of 'In-Context' Learning using a custom knowledge base that consists every possible information about plant diseases and how to reduce the spread and cure of the disease.

Below are a few screen shots of the chatbot in action
